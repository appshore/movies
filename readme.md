Movie Reviews
-------------

This is a set of [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) BDD style tests that define a specification for a fictional Movie Review library.

To view the specifications, clone this repository and open the page

    specs/specrunner.html

As you can see the tests are currently failing!

The subject of the tests is the javascript file

    lib/MovieReviews.js

This module defines some objects that could be used by to create and submit scored movie reviews.

  * Review -
    This model defines a single review for a movie. The movie is score on a points scale, represented by values from 0.0 to 1.0.

  * ReviewSummary -
    This model defines a summary of one or more reviews, and provides a way to get an average (mean) score.

  * MovieReviewService -
    This object provides methods for submitting reviews and getting review summaries.

  * MovieLocatorService -
    This object provides methods for finding and sorting movie information.


Your task is to fix the broken tests, and get this module working again.

If you need to add any additional library dependencies, feel free to do so.



My Movie DB
-----------

This HTML application is a simple Angular 1 app for a database of Movies scraped from IMDB.

The application files are in the directory

    /client
        /images
        app.js
        index.html
        movies.json
        paid-promotions.json
        readme.md
        style.css

The default page and entry point for the app is the HTML page
    
    index.html

Your task is to analyse the fictional client requirements listed in the README 
 
    /client/readme.md   

Then update the HTML application to fulfil the requirements to the best of your ability.

Please consider the user's experience, visual appeal and cross browser support.

Good luck and have fun!
